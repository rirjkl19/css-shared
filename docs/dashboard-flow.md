# Dashboard Flow (Ongoing)

This document describes the flow of the dashboard application.

## Overview

The CSS dashboard contains features that allow students to navigate to certain pages such as lessons, quizzes, and their grades.

Ideally this should contain the following features:

- [x] Greets the student with a welcome message
    > Partially done. But will redesign the welcome message to be more appealing.
- [x] A navigation bar that allows students to navigate to different pages
- [x] Card Widget that redirects students to different pages
- [x] Card Widget that displays the student's grades
- [ ] Card Widget that displays the student's progress
  - [ ] _Finished quizzes_ = (total of at least 1 attempt on the quiz) - (total number of quizzes)
  - [ ] _Total quizzes_ = total number of quizzes
  - [ ] _Percentage_ = (Finished quizzes / Total quizzes) \* 100

## Flow

The flow of the dashboard application is as follows:

1. The student logs in to the dashboard.
2. The student is greeted with a welcome message.
3. The student is presented with a navigation bar that allows them to navigate to different pages.
4. The student is presented with a card widget that redirects them to different pages.
5. The student is presented with a card widget that displays their grades.
6. The student is presented with a card widget that displays their progress.
